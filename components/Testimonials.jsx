                    Before our launch in October 2023, we have conducted
                    extensive user testing. Here are some of the reviews by our

                                As someone who is mindful of her health, I have
                                been worrying about the amount of electrical
                                devices in my office. My office is beside the
                                server equipment room and there are over 20
                                laptops and monitors around me. Due to the noisy
                                environment, I also have my earbuds on for long
                                hours working on my laptop.

                                I decided to bring the emGuarde with me, no
                                matter where I go. To my surprise, I was able to
                                concentrate better and I did not have any
                                dizziness or headache with my earbuds on for
                                long hours. The most important of all, I feel
                                less tired after work every day and am able to
                                go out for my regular exercises and meetups.

                                I am working from home and my work station is
                                very near to the wifi router. When I spent long
                                hours on my laptop everyday, I would experience
                                regular migraine, tired eyes, and fatigue.

                                Lately, I have some sleeping issue. I usually
                                sleep after 12 midnight, but somehow, still wake
                                up at around 6:30am, and not able to go back to
                                sleep again. This had made me feel very tired in
                                the late afternoons and led to poor
                                concentration on my work.

                                I am a practicing doctor and operate my own
                                private clinic in Selangor. I was pleasantly
                                surprised that emGuarde worked almost
                                instantaneously on me. Just two days into using
                                the emGuarde, the lethargy, body aches and pains
                                that I had accepted to be part and parcel of my
                                daily grind and long hours in the clinic, were
                                all gone. In my younger days, I was a very keen
                                and active sports person and hence have first
                                hand experience of muscle aches and pains caused
                                by sports, heavy and or sporadical physical
                                activity. The aches and pains I experienced at
                                work were different from what I would categorise
                                as injury associated with “sports and/or
                                physical exertion”. Thank you emGuarde, my
                                troubles (lethargy, aches & pains) are a thing
                                of the past now.
